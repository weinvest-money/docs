WeInvest provides a protocol to build investment platforms for trading cryptocurrencies, securities, and other fungible assets. WeInvest has released a dapp for trading cryptocurrencies and stocks. 

 

## Abstract 

 

The legend of Robinhood robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. The modern-day Robinhood, in the form of a C-Corp, albeit indirectly, does the exact opposite. 

 

Poor people don't have money for things they need, like food, water, and housing. When you give them money, this is where it goes. The U.S. government sent stimmy checks in 2020 and beyond, to rescue the economy. This is the largest bailout in history. 

 

Middle-class people have money for the things they need, but still get stimmy checks. When you give them money, they put the money to work for them, to make more money. Often this comes in the form of an investment. Investments can be in equities, cryptocurrencies, bonds, treasuries, and cash. 

 

Wealthy people have many opportunities to invest in speculative assets and private equity. These opportunities have traditionally been reserved for the wealthy and insiders at investment banks. In recent years, everyone has been able to invest in cryptocurrency tokens.

 

Efforts are being made to democratize private equity investment opportunities with crowdfunding, Crowd SAFE, DPA (debt payable by assets), and cryptocurrencies. The non-wealthy population now has some opportunity to make the kind of returns typically reserved for the wealthy. But there is not any way they can tap into the millions of dollars generated in trading fees. WeInvest sets out to solve this problem. 

 

The WeInvest DAO, allows users to sign up and start trading cryptocurrencies and stocks. Underneath the hood, the DAO connects to a growing collection of financial data services and brokerages. All trading fees generated, go into the DAO treasury. The community proposes and votes for how the DAO spends the treasury. 

 

## Introduction

 

WeInvest is the collection of APIs and partnerships to power mixed asset trading platforms. 

 

The WeInvest dapp, is an  implementation that consumes some of these APIs and demonstrates how to build a full fledged trading platform on top of these technologies.

 

Currently, the WeInvest dapp has been released in beta with a number of core features.

### KYC and AML Requirements 

Trading securities are regulated by FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority). All users of the  have undergone KYC for AML and money laundering policies. WeInvest takes a contrarian stance on this subject. The crypto community at large, is opposed to the invasion of privacy that comes with KYC. However, knowing your customers comes with many benefits. The details are outside the scope of this paper. 

 

Unidentified individuals have limited capabilities on our platforms, and may be limited to exclusively trading cryptocurrencies on decentralized exchanges and platforms.

 

## Stakeholders 

The WeInvest community makes up a large portion of the stakeholders. Other stakes are reserved for investors, developers, marketers, and operators. 

 

## Protocol Design 

The governance is designed on the Aragon optimistic governance protocol.

 

## Native Token 

The WeInvest native token is used to compensate stakeholders and to handle governance. 

 

## Conclusion 

The WeInvest DAO was conceived in mid 2021 after the IPOs of Coinbase and Robinhood. Millions of dollars are generated everyday, in the form of trading fees. In some cases these trading fees are waived, when the organization can generate revenue in other ways, such as PFOF (payment for order flow) and interest on cash balances. These fees are used to pay employees inflated salaries, and stuff the pockets of the board members and shareholders. The early investors are the ones who made the most. By the time the shares reach the public markets, the gains have already been had. The investors have already made 1000x or more, then the dump it onto the public markets for the average person to buy. 

 

We went from paying $60 to trade stocks, to paying $10 for trades, to paying $0 for trades. Next, we will be paid to trade. This is the WeInvest Manifesto.
